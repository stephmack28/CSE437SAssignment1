Scoops User Testing
September 4, 2018

Users were given the game and asked to play without any instruction from the hosts. Their feedback was prompted for, then collected based on three categories: graphics, gameplay, and satisfaction.

(+) positives
(-) negatives

Tester #1:

Graphics:
	+ Smooth, almost no screen tearing or slowdowns
	+ Simple and aesthetically pleasing
	- Yellow scoop is hard to see
Gameplay:
	- Pacing is abrupt, it goes from quite easy to quite difficult very fast
	- Cone powerup seems to expire too quickly, specifically when the game gets tough
Satisfaction:
	+ Game is a "good play", not too long but also not too short for its genre
	+ Easy enough to rack up points and progress
	
Tester #2:

Graphics:
	+ Cone moves back and forth without glitches
	- Minor screen tears seemingly randomly
Gameplay:
	+ Pacing seems normal, gets hard at the right time
	- Powerups seems ineffective because they do not last long enough
	- Sometimes maneuverability seems purposefully slowdowns
Satisfaction:
	- No sense of accomplishment at the end, score cannot be seen
	
Tester #3:

Graphics:
	+ No errors or problems noticed
	- Yellow scoop almost cannot be seen
Gameplay:
	+ Moving the cone is challenging enough, speed is fine
	- Too few powerups when the game gets harder towards the end
Satisfaction:
	- No comparison to other scores, like a high score list
	
Improvements to be made based on feedback:
	1. Switch yellow scoop color
	2. Improve powerup length but limit the width that a powerup can raise the cone to
	3. Add score display at the end of the game
	4. Add high score list
